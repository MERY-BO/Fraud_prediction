Fraud Detection and FastAPI Deployment:

Overview
This project aims to develop a fraud detection model using machine learning algorithms and deploy it through a FastAPI application. The goal is to predict fraudulent transactions based on the provided dataset, which includes features like transaction amount, time, and several other variables.

The fraud detection model leverages techniques to handle imbalanced data, and once trained, it is deployed using FastAPI for real-time predictions via a web service.

🚀 Project Features
Machine Learning Models:

Utilizes models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost to identify fraudulent transactions.
Achieved high accuracy and robustness even with imbalanced data using techniques like SMOTE and cross-validation.
FastAPI Deployment:

A RESTful API for real-time predictions.
Exposes endpoints that can receive transaction data and return fraud predictions.
End-to-End Pipeline:

Data preprocessing
Model training and evaluation
FastAPI deployment
Unbalanced Data Handling:

Addressed class imbalance through data resampling and performance metrics tailored for imbalanced datasets.
📊 Dataset
The dataset used for fraud detection includes the following features:

V1 to V28: Transaction features generated using PCA.
Amount: The transaction amount.
Time: The time of the transaction.
Class: Target variable (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).
Data Preprocessing:
Data cleaning (handling missing values).
Feature scaling and normalization.
Addressing class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
⚙️ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the API
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-fastapi.git
cd fraud-detection-fastapi
